**Echo**

_Charcoal on Paper_


This artwork depicts a solitary figure turned away, rendered in soft charcoal tones. The minimalistic approach and monochromatic palette create a sense of introspection and anonymity, inviting the viewer to contemplate the emotions and story behind the figureâ€™s stance. The blurred background and delicate shading highlight the contrast between the figure and its surroundings, emphasizing the solitary nature of the subject.
