**La Poussière du Temps**

_Gouache on Paper_


This artwork portrays a serene suburban house under a twilight sky. The use of gouache, with its opaque and matte finish, enhances the soft textures and muted pastel colors, evoking a sense of calm and nostalgia. The contrasting elements of the dark sky and the light hues of the house highlight the quiet stillness of the scene, inviting the viewer to ponder the stories within this tranquil setting.
